# FormValidationProject

Project for the Form Validation section of javascript in the real world from the odin projects fullstack javascript course.

PLAN:

Have each input be contained in a label with two spans as it's siblings.

Create a showError() function that takes the element it's referring to as an argument and validates based on that.

Call this function on input for whatever element is being inputted to, and run it for all elements of the form on submit.
